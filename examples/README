Though the form_test.php file shows usage, here are the basics to getting this up and running

* Run the sql file /sql/example.sql to create the table

* Change the class to have your host and credentials (in the init() function)

* Edit the form_test line that instantiates the metadata_validator class to point to your database and table name

If you have specific questions about the classes methods, read through the class file
